Today's Tasks üì±‚úÖ
A simple To-Do List application built with Android Jetpack Compose to practice clean architecture, modern Android development patterns, and cross-device support.

This project includes:

üì± Android App: A mobile to-do list application with task creation, completion tracking, and local persistence.

‚åö Wear OS Companion App: A lightweight module designed for Wear OS smartwatches, allowing users to quickly view and check off tasks from their wrist.

üöÄ Features

Phone app

.Create, read, update, and delete tasks with intuitive UI

.Real-time synchronization between UI and database

.Modern Material Design 3 interface with dark/light theme support

.Location-based tasks with geolocation support

.Offline functionality with local database persistence

.Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

Wear OS App

.Companion Wear OS module integrated in the same project

.View today‚Äôs tasks at a glance

.Check off completed tasks directly from the watch

.Built with Compose for Wear OS for optimized small-screen interactions

.Data synced with the phone app for consistency

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
.Architecture & Patterns
..MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) - Architecture pattern

..Clean Architecture - Layered approach for separation of concerns

..Repository Pattern - Single source of truth for data

..Unidirectional Data Flow - Predictable state management

.UI & Framework
..Jetpack Compose - Modern declarative UI toolkit

..Material Design 3 - Latest Google design system

.Android Jetpack Components:

..Navigation Compose - Type-safe navigation

..ViewModel - Lifecycle-aware UI data holder

..StateFlow - Reactive state management

.Lifecycle-aware components - Proper lifecycle management

.Dependency Injection
..Koin - Lightweight dependency injection framework

.Dependency Inversion - SOLID principles

.Database & Persistence
..Room Database - SQLite abstraction layer

.Flow - Real-time data observers

.Type Converters - Complex data type handling

.Asynchronous Programming
..Kotlin Coroutines - Asynchronous programming

..Flow - Reactive streams

..StateFlow/SharedFlow - State management

.Modern Development Practices
..Kotlin DSL - Type-safe Gradle configuration

..KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) - Faster than KAPT

..Sealed Interfaces/Classes - Type-safe state management

..Extension Functions - Kotlin idiomatic code

üéØ Key Learning Outcomes
Mastered Jetpack Compose for modern UI development

Implemented Clean Architecture with proper layer separation

Utilized Reactive Programming with Flow and StateFlow

Applied Dependency Injection with Koin

Practiced Modern Android Development best practices

Gained experience with Room Database and real-time updates

Implemented Type-Safe Navigation with Compose Navigation

Used KSP for improved build performance

üìä Performance Optimizations
Efficient Database Queries with Room

Smart Recompositions with Compose

Proper Coroutine Scoping with ViewModel

StateFlow for Minimal UI Updates

KSP for faster annotation processing

üåü Why This Project Stands Out
This application demonstrates proficiency in modern Android development practices including:

‚úÖ 100% Kotlin codebase

‚úÖ 100% Jetpack Compose UI

‚úÖ Modern Architecture patterns

‚úÖ Reactive Programming with Flow

‚úÖ Dependency Injection implementation

‚úÖ Type-Safe Navigation

‚úÖ Database Persistence with Room

‚úÖ Clean Code practices
