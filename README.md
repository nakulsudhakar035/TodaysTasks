Today's Tasks 📱✅
A modern, efficient Android task management app built with cutting-edge technologies to showcase best practices in Android development.

🚀 Features
Create, read, update, and delete tasks with intuitive UI

Real-time synchronization between UI and database

Modern Material Design 3 interface with dark/light theme support

Location-based tasks with geolocation support

Offline functionality with local database persistence

Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

🛠️ Technology Stack
Architecture & Patterns
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) - Architecture pattern

Clean Architecture - Layered approach for separation of concerns

Repository Pattern - Single source of truth for data

Unidirectional Data Flow - Predictable state management

UI & Framework
Jetpack Compose - Modern declarative UI toolkit

Material Design 3 - Latest Google design system

Android Jetpack Components:

Navigation Compose - Type-safe navigation

ViewModel - Lifecycle-aware UI data holder

StateFlow - Reactive state management

Lifecycle-aware components - Proper lifecycle management

Dependency Injection
Koin - Lightweight dependency injection framework

Dependency Inversion -遵循 SOLID principles

Database & Persistence
Room Database - SQLite abstraction layer

Flow - Real-time data observers

Type Converters - Complex data type handling

Asynchronous Programming
Kotlin Coroutines - Asynchronous programming

Flow - Reactive streams

StateFlow/SharedFlow - State management

Modern Development Practices
Kotlin DSL - Type-safe Gradle configuration

KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) - Faster than KAPT

Sealed Interfaces/Classes - Type-safe state management

Extension Functions - Kotlin idiomatic code

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
Mastered Jetpack Compose for modern UI development

Implemented Clean Architecture with proper layer separation

Utilized Reactive Programming with Flow and StateFlow

Applied Dependency Injection with Koin

Practiced Modern Android Development best practices

Gained experience with Room Database and real-time updates

Implemented Type-Safe Navigation with Compose Navigation

Used KSP for improved build performance

📊 Performance Optimizations
Efficient Database Queries with Room

Smart Recompositions with Compose

Proper Coroutine Scoping with ViewModel

StateFlow for Minimal UI Updates

KSP for faster annotation processing

This application demonstrates proficiency in modern Android development practices including:

✅ 100% Kotlin codebase

✅ 100% Jetpack Compose UI

✅ Modern Architecture patterns

✅ Reactive Programming with Flow

✅ Dependency Injection implementation

✅ Type-Safe Navigation

✅ Database Persistence with Room

✅ Clean Code practices
